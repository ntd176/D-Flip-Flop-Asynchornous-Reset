# D-Flip-Flop-Asynchornous-Reset-
# Introduction
- The asynchronous D latch is a useful electronic logic circuit widely employed in electronic designs.
- The asynchronous D RESET flip-flop operates in three modes:
  - (1) Data storage
  - (2) Circuit reset
  - (3) Input equals output when Reset is low and the CLK pulse is rising edge.
- Advantages:
  - Simple circuit, easy to design
  - Ability to operate at various clock frequencies
- Disadvantages:
  - May be slow
  - Consumes significant power
  - Susceptible to interference from external electrical signals.
